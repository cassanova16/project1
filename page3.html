            <p>In this article, we’ll be talking about The Kardashians Hulu reality TV show, The Kardashian Family, and
                some of the
                factors that may have edged it to become Hulu’s biggest series premiere in US history.</p>
            <p>The Kardashians is the sequel of Keeping Up with The Kardashians; a 20-season reality TV show that aired
                from 2007-2021.
                Just like its predecessor, the Kardashians Hulu stars the Kardashian family as its main cast too. It’s a
                no-brainer
                since the show is titled in their name.</p>
            <p>Before we discuss the hypothesis of what may have edged The Kardashians’ success, let’s quickly run a
                breakdown of the
                show’s concept for new (or potential) viewers.</p>
            <p>The Kardashians is a reality TV show centered on America’s most beloved and controversial family, the
                Kardashian family.
                While it’s about the entire family, the show revolves around the Kardashian sisters: 44-year-old
                Kourtney Kardashian,
                42-year-old Kim Kardashian, and 38-year-old Khloe Kardashian.</p>
            <p>The other cast includes: Rob Kardashian, the Kardashian brother who is named after their father Robert
                Kardashian who
                was famous for the OJ Simpsons case, Kris Jenner (their mother), and the Kardashian-Jenner sisters,
                Kendall Jenner, and
                Kylie Jenner.</p>

            <p>Now, that we’ve covered that, let’s look at some of the reasons that may have edged The Kardashians to
                become Hulu’s
                biggest series premiere in US history.</p>
            <p>Two years ago, it was announced that Keeping Up with the Kardashians would be ending after its
                fourteen-year run, and
                this left loyal fans hungry for more. It’s a no-brainer since the TV show was a thrilling, emotional
                roller coaster, and
                comedic show, focused on America’s most beloved and controversial family.</p>
            <p>Keeping Up with the Kardashians had a lot of fun moments, ranging from Khloe going to jail to Kim and
                Khloe throwing
                fists on screen, and the insight the show gave into what Kim Kardashian and Kanye West’s relationship
                was like. For more

                    Episodes of Keeping Up with the Kardashians To Watch Before Hulu’s Kardashians</a></p>
            <p>It could be the hype and quality of the original show Keeping Up with the Kardashians, that made Hulu’s
                The Kardashians
                a success as eager fans couldn’t wait to see their favorite family on screen once again. As they say,
                nothing like good
                gossip.</p>
            <p>Now that you’ve made it to the end of this article, I’d like to point out that while the show is mostly
                staged, it’s
                usually the unscripted lines and actions that drive it, and keep the viewer on edge.</p>
